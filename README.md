# facebookpostbot
A script that automatically posts randomly generated sentences with elements such as emojis, symbols, and predefined "actual words" based on chance to Facebook. Takes care of the login process and everything else. Currently running on an old Windows tablet to post every 30 minutes using Windows Task Scheduler.

This is one of the first practical projects I have worked on since I started to learn Python/Programming during downtime at my Electrical Engineering Internship about three weeks ago.
