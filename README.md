# facebookpostbot
A script that automatically posts randomly generated sentences with elements such as emojis, symbols, and predefined "actual words" based on chance to Facebook. Takes care of the login process and everything else. Currently running on an old Windows tablet to post every 30 minutes using Windows Task  Scheduler.
